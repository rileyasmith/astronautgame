# astronautgame
This is a Python game I made called Astronaut Adventure!

# Instructions
To run this game, use the CS in Schools Code Editor: https://csinschools.io/code-editor
The reason you need to use this is due to the package that allows me to use labels and colours. I haven't found an alternative for this so currently, you cannot play using IDLE.
