# Astronaut Adventure
This is a Python text-based game I made called Astronaut Adventure for a school project! It is unfinished at the time of writing (21/03/2024) but I will add more to it! :D 

Houston, we have a problem... You are an astronaut lost in space. You slipped off the space station during maintenance. Your goal is to get back to the space station.

## Getting Started
To run this game, use the CS in Schools Code Editor: https://csinschools.io/code-editor
The reason you need to use this is due to the package that allows me to use labels and colours. I haven't found an alternative for this so currently, you cannot play using IDLE.

### Installation
The installation for Astronaut Adventure is very easy and very quick. 
```
1. Open the current version (v0.1.0) under the "Releases" tab.
2. Copy the code to your device's clipboard.
3. Open the CS in Schools Code Editor: https://csinschools.io/code-editor
4. Hit the "Run" button above the code editing window.
5. Enjoy the game! :D
