# Astronaut Adventure
This is a Python game I made called Astronaut Adventure for a school project! It is unfinished at the time of writing (21/03/2024) but I will add more to it! :D 
Houston, we have a problem... You are an astronaut lost in space. You slipped off the space station during maintenance. Your goal is to get back to the space station.

## Getting Started
To run this game, use the CS in Schools Code Editor: https://csinschools.io/code-editor
The reason you need to use this is due to the package that allows me to use labels and colours. I haven't found an alternative for this so currently, you cannot play using IDLE.
