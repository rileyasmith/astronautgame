Using Google Gemini, I made it generate colours for the game's inputs, questions, etc.

Here are some color suggestions for your Astronaut Adventure game, considering the "Colour.{colour} +" command:

**Questions:**

* **Blue or Teal:** These colors are often associated with inquiry, knowledge, and technology, making them a good fit for questions that require problem-solving or exploration.
* **White or Light Gray:**  These neutral colors can provide a clean and professional look for questions and stand out well against a darker background. 

**Inputs:**

* **Green:** Green is often associated with "go" or "proceed," making it a good choice for user inputs, especially for confirming actions.

Here are some additional factors to consider:

* **Background color:** The chosen colors should provide good contrast with the background for readability.
* **Overall theme:**  Consider the overall theme of your game (e.g., futuristic, whimsical) when choosing colors.
* **Accessibility:** Ensure there is enough contrast between text and background colors for players with visual impairments.

Ultimately, the best choice depends on your personal preference and the overall aesthetic you want to achieve for Astronaut Adventure. Don't hesitate to experiment with different colors to see what works best!
